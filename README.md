Enhanced bookmarks

Today's browsers fail to offer decent bookmark management experience. 
It is either suboptimal or impossible to do the following things:
- add notes to a bookmark
- search notes
- view recently added bookmarks
- assign labels to bookmarks
 
Yes, there are folders, but experience with those is very clumsy. Menus immediately collapse. Moving a bookmark to a separate folder is not a pleasant experience. 
 
_**Bluejay**_ will try to make those things better.
It will be implemented as REST API written in Go. There will be a static webpage to find and manage your bookmarks. Later, browser plugins might be implemented.
 
There should be an option to export your bookmarks, so you can always take your data with you.
